#### Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters

Given a string, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

Example 1:

>Input: "abcabcbb"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "abc", with the length of 3.

Example 2:

>Input: "bbbbb"
Output: 1
Explanation: The answer is "b", with the length of 1.

Example 3:

>Input: "pwwkew"
Output: 3
Explanation: The answer is "wke", with the length of 3.
             Note that the answer must be a substring, "pwke" is a subsequence and not a substring.



#### My Solution

Runtime:

```Java
public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        int ans = 0, i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < n && j < n) {
            // try to extend the range [i, j]
            if (!set.contains(s.charAt(j))){
                set.add(s.charAt(j++));
                ans = Math.max(ans, j - i);
            }
            else {
                set.remove(s.charAt(i++));
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```
