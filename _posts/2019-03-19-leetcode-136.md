### Single Number

Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

Note:

Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?

Example 1:

>Input: [2,2,1]
Output: 1

Example 2:

>Input: [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4


#### Approach 4: Bit Manipulation

Runtime: 0ms

```Java
class Solution {
    public int singleNumber(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        for(int i : nums) {
            result ^= i;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```
